  <h2>Rising temperatures and melting ice</h2>

    <p>
      Global warming refers to an increase in the average temperature around the world. 
      This rise in temperature is caused by several possible phenomena, such as 
      greenhouse gas emissions produced by humans when using various fossil fuels 
      such as coal, oil, or gas, as well as deforestation and certain agricultural practices involving the use of nitrous oxide in nitrogen fertilizers, as well as methane, which causes 28 times more warming than CO2 and is responsible for a 20% increase in temperature, or a 1-degree increase over the course of the century, according to the website inrae.fr. According to the United Nations website, the WMO has estimated that the average global temperature increase was between 1.34 and 1.41 degrees and predicts an increase of up to 1.44 degrees between 2015 and 2034 compared to pre-industrial levels.
      According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service website, rising temperatures are causing major meteorological and environmental changes, with periods of severe drought such as in the summer of 2022, when major rivers such as the Rhine in Germany and the Loire in France experienced extremely low water levels, causing difficulties for river transport and electricity production.
      Global warming has also caused ice to melt, as in the Arctic, where the surface area of sea ice in summer has decreased by 40% since the end of 1970, putting certain animal species such as polar bears, which need ice to hunt seals, on the verge of extinction, according to NASA. Another example is the melting of ice in Greenland, where the country lost 532 billion tons of ice in 2019, causing sea levels to rise by 1.5 millimeters, according to the website WWF.fr.
      Climate change is also causing sea levels to rise. In 2024, the average sea level rose by 10 centimeters due to thermal expansion (= the temperature of seawater increases due to rising air temperatures. Warmer water expands), according to the Science et vie website. Many villages are regularly flooded. For example, the village of Ceton was hit twice by floods in 2024, according to the Ouest-France website, and China experienced numerous floods in regions such as Hunan and Guangxi, where rivers such as the Yangtze and Pearl rivers overflowed. The province of Hunan suffered 100 deaths and significant material damage, according to the Environmental Reports website. 
      Global warming directly affects oceans and seas around the world. They are experiencing an increase in surface temperature, gradual acidification, and a rise in average water levels. These changes have visible effects on marine ecosystems and human populations living near or on coastlines.
      The melting of glaciers and ice caps has a huge impact on sea level rise, and the melting of ice is accelerating every year. ²     In Pacific islands such as Kiribati and the Marshall Islands, certain areas are affected by high tides, forcing residents to relocate their villages, while others are leaving these areas as the situation worsens year after year. 
      The US Environmental Protection Agency explains that sea level rise will cause several problems in the future, such as flooding of coastal wetlands and low-lying areas, accelerated beach erosion, and salinization of groundwater. These consequences threaten our food supply by reducing the amount of available agricultural land and disrupting our ecosystems. For example, in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, the presence of salt water in rice fields renders them unusable, jeopardizing agricultural production on which millions of people depend.
      The rise in ocean surface temperatures is contributing to the development of extreme weather events such as cyclones and hurricanes. For example, in the United States, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Maria in 2017 were intensified by the heat of the Atlantic Ocean.
      Ocean currents play an important role in regulating the temperature and climate of our planet. They transport heat, nutrients, and salt from one ocean to another. This current is called thermohaline and depends on two factors: salinity and water temperature. Unfortunately, global warming and melting ice are disrupting this circulation system. When ice melts, a very large amount of fresh water is released into the ocean. This less salty water mixes with the salty water of the oceans, slowing down ocean currents.
 
      The reduction in these currents has a significant impact on marine life. The vertical movements of the oceans allow nutrients to rise to the surface of the water. If circulation decreases, the amount of nutrients available at the surface also decreases, reducing the productivity of the oceans and endangering fish and other marine species. 
      According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, this decline in productivity could threaten populations that rely heavily on fishing for their livelihoods, such as those in developing countries.
      Another problem concerns the oceans' ability to store carbon. The oceans absorb a quarter of the CO2 emitted by human activities. The more the currents decrease, the more this ability to absorb CO2 decreases. This means that more CO2 would remain in the atmosphere and further increase global warming.
      A phenomenon known as the “North Atlantic cold spot” corresponds to a sharp drop in salinity and a cooling of surface waters. Scientists have discovered this phenomenon in Iceland and Greenland.
      According to NASA, this phenomenon is linked to the slowing of the Gulf Stream (the ocean current between the east coast of Florida and North Carolina). If NASA's theory is correct, the consequences could be global, causing disruptions to the rainy seasons in Africa, a rise in sea levels on the east coast of the United States, and upheaval in marine biodiversity.
      Ocean currents, which are invisible to the naked eye, are often a key factor in global warming.

    <h2>Ocean acidification</h2>

    <p>
    The ocean plays a major role in regulating the climate because it absorbs nearly a quarter of the carbon dioxide (CO₂) produced by human activities. But this process has a negative effect: when it absorbs too much CO₂, the ocean forms carbonic acid, which releases hydrogen ions and increases the acidity of the water. This results in a decrease in pH. Since the beginning of the industrial era, the average pH of the ocean has fallen from around 8.2 to 8.1. This drop of 0.1 units may seem small, but it actually corresponds to an increase in acidity of around 30%. IPCC projections estimate that if emissions continue at the current rate, the pH could fall by a further 0.3 to 0.4 by 2100, making the ocean much more acidic than it has been for millions of years.
    
    This acidification, combined with rising water temperatures, poses a direct threat to calcifying organisms, i.e., those that build their shells or skeletons with calcium carbonate. This includes corals, mollusks such as oysters and mussels, and many crustaceans. Their shells or skeletons become more fragile and dissolve more easily in acidic water. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports, for example, that in some areas of the US West Coast, oyster farms have already suffered significant losses because larvae were unable to form their shells properly.
    Coral reefs, which are home to around 25% of the world's marine biodiversity, are particularly vulnerable. According to the UN, warming limited to 1.5°C could lead to the destruction of 70-90% of coral reefs. If the temperature rises by 2°C, almost 100% of reefs would disappear. Australia's Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has already suffered several massive bleaching events in 2016, 2017, and 2020 due to thermal stress and acidification. (Source: Australian Institute of Marine Science).

    This decline has serious repercussions on biodiversity and human communities.
    Coral reefs play a crucial role as nurseries for many fish, which are a source of food for millions of people.
    Their disappearance therefore means fewer fish and thus a threat to food security, particularly in developing coastal countries. According to the FAO, more than 3 billion people worldwide depend directly on marine resources for food.
    Acidification also affects the base of the marine food chain: phytoplankton and certain species of calcifying plankton such as pteropods, small mollusks that serve as food for many fish and marine mammals. If these organisms disappear, the entire ecosystem will collapse. A study conducted in the Southern Ocean and published in Nature Geoscience showed that in some areas, pteropod shells were already beginning to dissolve due to acidification.
    The economic consequences are also significant. Fishing and aquaculture face direct threats. In the Philippines and Indonesia, millions of people depend on coral reefs for food and tourism-related income. The disappearance of these reefs will not only lead to a loss of biodiversity, but also have an economic impact on these nations.

    As a result, ocean acidification is less visible than sea level rise, but its repercussions are just as severe. It weakens corals, mollusks, crustaceans, and plankton, which form the foundation of marine life. It jeopardizes the food and economic security of millions of people around the world and could profoundly alter the oceans by the end of the century if measures are not taken to reduce CO₂ emissions.

    <h2>Variation in salinity</h2>
    <p>
    The salinity of the oceans corresponds to the amount of salt present in the sea. It is measured in
    PSU (Practical Salinity Unit), which corresponds to the average salinity of the oceans, expressed
    in grams of salt per liter of water. The salinity of the oceans averages 35 PSU, which
    is roughly equivalent to five teaspoons of salt per liter of seawater. According to the Copernicus Marine Service website,
    PSU values vary in certain regions,
    such as the North Atlantic, where salinity is 30 PSU, which is lower than
    the global average. Conversely, it can be as high as 40 PSU in warm seas such as the
    Red Sea.

    Global warming plays a major role in salinity variation. For example,
    when precipitation increases and ice melts, large amounts of fresh water
    flow into the ocean, diluting the salt water and reducing its salinity. Conversely,
    in warm areas where evaporation is very high, salinity is higher,
    as in the Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf. Global warming affects
    each area of the planet differently.
    Changes in salinity have an impact on marine ecosystems where marine species
    such as fish and plankton are sensitive to changes in salinity. For example,
    in estuaries, salt water linked to rising sea levels can disrupt ecosystems. According to
    the UN, in the Tuvalu Islands in the Pacific, freshwater aquifers are
    being submerged by salt water, making drinking water difficult to access and threatening the survival
    of the inhabitants.
